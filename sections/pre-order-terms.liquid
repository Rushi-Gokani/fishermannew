    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Pre-Order Terms and Conditions</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Availability:</h3>
    <p>Pre-order items may not be immediately available in our inventory. These items may be coming soon, and are available for pre-order in anticipation of restocking.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Pre-Order Pricing:</h3>
    <p>Some products may be eligible for a discount if you choose to pay in full at the time of pre-ordering. In such cases, the pre-order price will be lower than the standard price (MRP) displayed on the product page. You may also opt to make a partial payment, which will typically range between 10% to 25% of the product's price, to confirm your pre-order.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Timeline:</h3>
    <p>Upon receiving your partial payment, we will inform you of the estimated time required to deliver the item.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Delivery Times:</h3>
    <p>Delivery time varies depending on whether the item is already in one of our warehouses or is expected to arrive soon. We generally accept pre-orders only for products that are likely to be available within 30-60 days.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Refund Policy:</h3>
    <p>If you choose not to wait for the communicated delivery timeline, you may request a refund. The refund will be processed in full, minus any applicable payment processing fees.</p>
    <p>If a refund is not requested within the given timeframe, it will be considered as your agreement to the timeline, and the order will proceed.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Refund Processing:</h3>
    <p>Refunds will be credited to the original payment method only.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Refund Timeline:</h3>
    <p>Refunds typically take 2-8 business days to process.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Fees and Charges:</h3>
    <p>Any processing fees that apply will be minimal, usually ranging from 1% to 2% of the amount paid in advance.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Final Payment:</h3>
    <p>When the item arrives at our main or partner warehouse, we will notify you to complete the remaining payment, including any applicable shipping charges.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Deadline for Final Payment:</h3>
    <p>The balance payment and shipping charges must be made within 3 business days of notification that the pre-ordered item is available.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Forfeiture of Advance Payment:</h3>
    <p>Failure to make the remaining payment within 3 business days may result in forfeiture of the entire or part of pre-paid amount. After this period, we reserve the right to offer the item to other customers for purchase.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Shipping:</h3>
    <p>Once the final payment is complete, the item will be shipped to your specified address, with an expected delivery time of 4-8 days.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Delivery Extension:</h3>
    <p>If the item does not arrive within the initial 30-60 days, the delivery period may be extended by an additional 30 days. Should there be further delays beyond this extension, you will have the option to request a full refund of the prepaid amount or wait till the item is available.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Shipping Insurance:</h3>
    <p>To safeguard against potential losses or damages during transit, we recommend opting for shipping insurance. The insurance cost will be communicated to you prior to shipping.</p>

    <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Acceptance: If you place a pre-order with us, it will mean that you have read and accepted all these terms and conditions and agree to the same.</p>
